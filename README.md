# DevCareeer-Table-Assignment
I'm currently enrolled in the DevCareer Bootcamp, Front-end engineering track, and this is the first assignment we've been given.
The assignment required that we Build a well-responsive table with 20 records. With only HTML and CSS, and then push your code to GitHub. We where also told to ensure our table was responsive on all devices.
